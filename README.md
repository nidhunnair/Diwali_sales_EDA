#Diwali Sales EDA
This mini project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Diwali sales data. It was one of my first projects in Python during my first year as a BSc Data Science student.

##Objective
The goal of this project was to explore and analyze the dataset using basic EDA techniques and to become familiar with essential Python packages such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. I followed tutorials on YouTube to understand how these libraries work and applied the concepts in this project.

##Libraries Used
Pandas: For data loading, inspection, and basic cleaning
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating basic visualizations

##Key Steps
Loaded and explored the dataset using Pandas
Performed basic data cleaning like handling missing values
Created visualizations to understand sales trends, customer demographics, and purchase patterns

##Learning Outcome
This project helped me get hands-on experience with data handling and visualization in Python.
